He didn't know why they were there... but they were. Behind the closed door in the corner of the room, he heard a scratching noise. As they stepped into the room he could see the gun gripped tightly in his hand. 

He asked " Why is this happening?" No reply. Silence. He wondered if he should run or ask again, why this misunderstanding occurred between the two of them. Suddenly there is the sound of gun fire as a bullet goes flying by him, nearly piercing his skull.
