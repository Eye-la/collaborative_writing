He didn't know why they were there... but they were. Behind the closed door in the corner of the room, he heard a scratching noise. As they stepped into the room he could see the gun gripped tightly in his hand. 

He asked " Why is this happening?" No reply. Silence. He wondered if he should run or ask again, why this misunderstanding occurred between the two of them. Suddenly there is the sound of gun fire as a bullet goes flying by him, nearly piercing his skull. He ducked for cover and crawled his way over to the wall closest to him. With his hand up, he uttered, "Please, don't kill me!"

Somehow he was still alive, it turned out he had his father's lucky liquor flask take the majority of the impact of the bullet. He took it out of his pocket and drank some whiskey.

Waiting for the next shot to be fired, he closed his eyes. Nothing flashed before his eyes - no family, no freinds. His only friend was trying to kill him. He knew this was the end.
